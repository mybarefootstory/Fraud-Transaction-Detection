# Fraudulent Transaction Identification System

<h2>Goal:</h2> 
The primary goal of this project is to create a system capable of identifying fraudulent transactions in financial activities. Using machine learning algorithms and advanced data analysis techniques, we aim to build a reliable solution that strengthens the security and dependability of financial operations.

<h2>Dataset Information:</h2> 
We utilized a dataset containing **6,362,620 rows** and **11 columns** for this project. The dataset includes various features that describe different aspects of financial transactions:

<ul>
<li><b>step</b>: A time step unit in hours, ranging from 1 to 744, representing a simulation of 30 days.</li>
<li><b>type</b>: The type of transaction, which can be CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT, or TRANSFER.</li>
<li><b>amount</b>: The transaction amount in the local currency.</li>
<li><b>nameOrig</b>: The identifier for the customer initiating the transaction.</li>
<li><b>oldbalanceOrg</b>: The balance of the initiating account before the transaction.</li>
<li><b>newbalanceOrig</b>: The balance of the initiating account after the transaction.</li>
<li><b>nameDest</b>: The identifier for the account receiving the transaction.</li>
<li><b>oldbalanceDest</b>: The balance of the destination account before the transaction (no data available for merchants).</li>
<li><b>newbalanceDest</b>: The balance of the destination account after the transaction (no data available for merchants).</li>
<li><b>isFraud</b>: A binary indicator showing whether the transaction was fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0).</li>
<li><b>isFlaggedFraud</b>: A binary flag for transactions flagged as illegal, typically those attempting to transfer over 200,000 in a single transaction.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Execution:</h2> 
To implement the solution, we processed the dataset, applying feature engineering to extract important information. We used various machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision trees, and XGBoost to train our models on the labeled data. These models learned patterns from past fraudulent activities, allowing them to predict fraud in new, unseen transactions. We evaluated the models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and fine-tuned the parameters to improve performance, with XGBoost yielding the highest accuracy.

<h2>Use Cases:</h2> 
This fraud detection system has applications across the financial industry, including banking, online payments, insurance, and e-commerce platforms. It can be integrated with existing transaction processing systems to provide real-time fraud detection and prevention.
The system helps institutions detect suspicious transactions, protect customers from fraud, and reduce financial losses. Additionally, it aids in investigations by providing insights into fraudulent behavior and tracing offenders.

<h2>Results:</h2> 
<b>Performance Evaluation:</b> 
We evaluated the model's performance on both the training and testing datasets using various metrics:

<ul>
<li><b>For Model Trained on df:</b><br>
Test Set:<br>
o Accuracy: 0.9987<br>
o F1 Score: 0.9987<br>
o ROC AUC Score: 0.9987<br><br>

<li><b>For Model Trained on df2:</b><br>
Test Set:<br>
o Accuracy: 0.9977<br>
o F1 Score: 0.9977<br>
o ROC AUC Score: 0.9977<br><br>
</ul>

<b>Interpretation:</b> 
The model trained on the full dataset (df) performed better than the one trained on df2 (limited to transfers and cash-outs), suggesting that including other transaction types enhanced performance. Both models exhibited high accuracy, F1 scores, and strong ROC AUC values, indicating they were effective in detecting fraudulent transactions.

<b>Key Feature Insights:</b> 
Using XGBoost, we found the following insights into feature importance:

<ul>
<li><b>diffOrg</b> was the most influential feature in detecting fraud, followed by <b>oldbalanceOrg</b>, <b>transaction amount</b>, and <b>newbalanceDest</b>.</li>
<li><b>isFlaggedFraud</b> contributed minimally to predictions, likely due to the low number of flagged transactions.</li>
<li><b>diffDest</b> had higher sample coverage but lower gain compared to <b>CASH_IN</b>.</li>
<li>The <b>step</b> feature had relatively high weight, but lower gain, likely due to the even distribution of fraud across the steps.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Future Enhancements:</h2> 
To further improve the fraud detection system, we suggest the following approaches:

<ul>
<li><b>Increase data collection:</b> More data, particularly on fraudulent transactions, will help improve the modelâ€™s performance.</li>
<li><b>Advanced techniques:</b> Explore advanced machine learning approaches like anomaly detection or deep learning models to capture more complex fraud patterns.</li>
<li><b>Continuous updates:</b> Regularly updating the model with fresh data will help it adapt to evolving fraud tactics.</li>
<li><b>Collaborate with industry experts:</b> Working with financial experts and cybersecurity professionals will provide domain-specific knowledge that can further enhance the model.</li>
</ul>
